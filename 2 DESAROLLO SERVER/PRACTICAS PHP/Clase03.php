        Exercise 3
        Make a script that generates 7 random numbers to play the Euromillones game. The first 5 numbers
        must be between 1 and 50, and the last 2 numbers must be between 1 and 12. Use the function
        mt_rand() (read the documentation).
        The numbers must be stored in two numeric arrays, one for the numbers between 1 and 50 and the
        other for the numbers from 1 to 12. Donâ€™t worry if the numbers are repeated.
        Once stored, show them using the arrays orderly, from least to greatest number
